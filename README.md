# Class Registration Macro

Made to ensure I would able to register for the classes I wanted in the precious few seconds I had before they filled up.

Created using JitBit Macro Recorder.

Later work to replace this with a more advanced Python/Selenium solution was abandoned when it became clear I would be able to guarantee getting in the classes I wanted without it.

* Uploaded as sample of:
  * another of the many quick scripts I've pulled together to automate tasks
  * one of the first "programs" I ever wrote
    * at this point; I had been using JitBit for years; learning entirely through experimentation
    * this is a medium-low complexity example
      * much more complex macros were needed for tasks that required (unsupported) abilities like:
        * storing multiple variables
          * achieved by using the clipboard to implement what I later learned are stacks and arrays
        * conditionals involving user input given during execution
          * achieved by opening/resizing/moving multiple notepad windows, pasting descriptions of the options in them, and choosing based on which one the user closes
